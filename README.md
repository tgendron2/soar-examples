# Artifact examples

[Example]Prompt - create artifact is a simple playbook that prompts the user for three values (bass, treble, and volume). It creates an artifact calld "Hi fidelity" and saves the three values as key/values in the artifact. 
The example shows how to use  a format block to set up the values for the create artifiact utility. It needs an empty container to run off.
